## System Architecture for Autocomplete Feature

### Goals of the Autocomplete Design
* Performance: The autocomplete feature should provide suggestions quickly, ideally within milliseconds, to ensure a smooth user experience. This is achieved by leveraging in-memory data stores and efficient search algorithms. Provide suggestions quickly as users type to ensure a smooth user experience.
* Scalability: Although the system serves no more than 100 users simultaneously, it should be designed to handle potential future growth. This is achieved by using scalable technologies and architectures.
* Accuracy: The suggestions should be relevant and accurate, providing users with the most likely matches based on their input. This is achieved by using advanced search algorithms and indexing techniques.

* Flexibility: Allow searching across different categories (players, teams, leagues).

## To achieve these goals, I propose the following system architecture:
* Frontend Application: A web interface where users input search queries.
* Load Balancer: Distributes incoming requests across multiple application servers to ensure even load distribution and high availability.
* Application Servers: Handle requests from the frontend and communicate with other components.
* Autocomplete Service: Uses a trie data structure for efficient prefix matching and fast lookups.
* Cache Layer: Stores frequently accessed results to reduce database load and improve response times.
* Database: Stores comprehensive data on players, teams, and leagues.
* Search Index: Optimized for full-text search capabilities.

## This design achieves the goals through:
* Fast response time: The trie data structure in the Autocomplete Service allows for quick prefix matching. The cache layer further reduces latency for common queries.
* Accuracy: The trie structure and search index ensure relevant suggestions based on partial input.
* Scalability: The load balancer and multiple application servers allow the system to handle up to 100 simultaneous users efficiently. The cache layer helps reduce load on the database for popular queries.
* Flexibility: The database and search index are structured to accommodate different categories (players, teams, leagues), allowing for versatile search capabilities.
